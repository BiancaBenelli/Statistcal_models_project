# Statistcal_models_project

**Brief description of the dataset**\
This dataset provides data on weather from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2016. This dataset contains 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, collected every ten minutes.

**Project steps**\
The main aim of this project is to perform weather forecasting for the period January-December 2016.\
Following what we have seen during the lessons, a comprehensive pipeline should be devised, including:
1. Loading, converting and cleaning of the data (note: aggregate the data in order to have weekly frequency).
Divide your dataset into training and testing;
2. Exploring the dataset with descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. Use appropriate graphs to visualise
the data at hand;
3. Describing the time series patterns (visually and numerically);
4. Focusing on temperature (degC, dependent variable), build the most appropriate models to forecast the
data for the specified period. Evaluate the model performance using different metrics. Visualise the results with appropriate graphs.

For the different steps, comment on the main results and any relevant observation/finding you have noticed.
